I am **David Sepashvili** <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/david-sepashvili-5a3350b5" target="_blank">:(fab fa-linkedin):</a> <a href="https://t.me/RuthlessAndRude" target="_blank">:(fab fa-telegram-plane):</a> <a href="mailto:ruthless.rude.david@gmail.com" target="_blank">:(far fa-envelope):</a>, an Infrastructure Security Engineer from <u>:(fas fa-map-marker-alt): Saint Petersburg, Russia</u>. I work at [Intermedia.net, Inc](https://intermedia.com) as a Senior Security Engineer. My professional interest rests on a defensive side, mostly:
* Security Monitoring and Alerting (SIEM, SOC),
* Cloud security (AWS),
* Linux security,
* Vulnerability management,

but I try to balance it with knowledge and hands-on experience in manual penetration testing (OSCP, HtB).
